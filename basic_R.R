## 
I have discussed the [Gapminder dataset](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html) in my videos and we shall use it throughout this training. It's available through CRAN, so make sure to install it. Here's how to load in all required packages:
  
  ```{r , warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
#install.packages("gapminder")
library(hrbrthemes)
library(viridis)
library(kableExtra)
options(knitr.table.format = "html")
library(plotly)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggrepel)

```

---
  # The dataset is provided in the gapminder library
  
  ```{r}
library(gapminder)

gapminder %>% filter(country=="Sweden")%>%
  mutate(gdpPercap=round(gdpPercap,0), lifeExp=round(lifeExp,2))%>%kable()%>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F)

```

---
  ## Information in **gapminder** data
  
  `View` command opens data in new worksheet while glimpse lists nature of variables (numeric/character/factor...) and total number of rows and columns.

```{r data-structure, comment= ""}
glimpse(gapminder) # We see that there are 1704 rows for 6 columns and also tells nature of variable
#View(gapminder)    # This opens up full data in a new window
```

---
  ```{r }
summary(gapminder) 

```

---
  # dplyr features
  
  ### `filter()` to keep selected observations
  ### `select()` to keep selected variables
  ### `arrange()` to reorder observations by a value
  ### `mutate()` to create new variables
  ### `summarize()` to create summary statistics
  ### `group_by()` for performing operations by group
  
  ---
  
  # `Select()`
  ## Column Selection
  For example `PDHS` files have more than 5000 columns in some files and maybe 40 or 50 or even fewer than that are needed for your analysis. __`Select()`__ function of R's dplyr is used to select columns of your interest

```{r}
gapminder %>% select(country, pop, lifeExp)
```

---
In case you want to select most of the variables and drop one or two, you may proceed as follows

```{r}
gapminder %>% select(-gdpPercap)

```


---
## Data Filtering

### `filter()` funtion
```{r}
gapminder_07<- gapminder %>% filter(year==2007)
kbl(gapminder_07[1:10,])%>%kable_styling(fixed_thead=T)
```

---
##>` Have we accidently deleted all other rows? Answer is no.` 
    
### Nope:  If you don't believe me try entering gapminder at the console. 

```{r tables}
gapminder %>% filter(year==2007)

```
---
  ## Filtering with respect to two variables
  
  ### One can apply multiple `filters`
  
  ```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(year==2007,country=="Sri Lanka")

gapminder %>% filter(year==2007, country=="Pakistan")

```

---
  
  ### Now we are selecting multiple countries for year 2007.
  
  ```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(year==2007, country %in% c("India", "Pakistan","Bangladesh", "Afghanistan", "Iran"))
```

---
  ## Filtering data for South Asia countries
  
  ```{r}
gapminderSA<-gapminder %>% filter(country %in% c("Bangladesh","India","Pakistan","Sri Lanka","Nepal", "Afghanistan","Bhutan", "Maldives"))
gapminderSA
```


---
  ## Sort data with `arrange()`
  
  
  ```{r}
gapminderSA %>% arrange(gdpPercap)

```
---
  ### Note that by default `arrange()` sorts in ascending order. If we want to sort in descending order, we use the function `desc()`.
  
  ```{r}
gapminderSA %>% arrange(desc(gdpPercap))
```

---
  ## Life Expectancy in South Asia in 2007
  
  What is the lowest and highest life expectancy among South Asian countries?
  
  ```{r}
gapminderSA %>% filter(year==2007) %>%  arrange(lifeExp)
```

### What was it in 1952?
---
  ## `mutate()` to change existing or create new variable
  
  
  ```{r}
gapminderSA %>% mutate(pop=pop/1000000)
```

---
  If we want to calculate GDP, we need to multiply gdpPercap by pop.    

But wait! Didn't we just change pop so it's expressed in millions? 
  No: we never stored the results of our previous command, we simply displayed them. Just as I discussed above, unless you overwrite it, the original gapminder dataset will be unchanged. With this in mind, we can create the gdp variable as follows:
  
  ```{r}
gapminderSA %>% mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
```

---
  ## How to calculate new variables
  As mentioned above, `mutate` is used to calculate new variable. Here we have calculated a new variable `gdp` and then `arrange()` data and selected `top_n(10)` countries to see whether higher `lifeExpectancy` and higher `gdp` are linked or not? 
  
  ```{r top-10}
gapminder %>% filter(year==2007) %>% 
  mutate(gdp=gdpPercap*pop) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdp)) %>% 
  top_n(10)

```
---
  `transmute()` keeps only the derived column. Let's use it in the example from above:

```{r }
gapminder %>% filter(year==2007) %>% 
  transmute(gdp=gdpPercap*pop) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdp)) %>% 
  top_n(10)

```
---
## Ordering

 arrange data by life expectancy, we use `arrange()` function

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, year,lifeExp) %>% 
  filter(year==2007) %>% 
  arrange(lifeExp)

```
---
top to bottom, then use `arrange(desc())` command as follows:

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, year,lifeExp) %>% 
  filter(year==2007) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lifeExp))

```
---
### Top 5

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  select(country, year,lifeExp) %>% 
  filter(year==2007) %>% 
  arrange(desc(lifeExp)) %>% 
  top_n(5)

```
---
# Summarising data

Another feature of dplyr is `summarise` data

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(year==2007) %>% group_by(continent) %>% summarise(mean=mean(lifeExp),min=min(lifeExp),max=max(lifeExp))
```
---

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  summarise(avglifeExp=mean(lifeExp))

```
---
## Summarising data by groups

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007, continent == "Asia") %>%
  summarize(avgLifeExp = mean(lifeExp)) 

```

---
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  filter(year==2007) %>% 
  summarize(avglife=mean(lifeExp))

```
---

W## we could get the mean, maximum, and mean life expectancy of the entire dataset. 

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  summarise(
    lifeExp_min = min(lifeExp),
    lifeExp_max = max(lifeExp),
    lifeExp_mean = mean(lifeExp)
  )
```
---
For example, let’s say we want to get the mean, minimum, and maximum of life expectancy, but instead of for the entire dataset, we want to see it for each year. 

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    lifeExp_min = min(lifeExp),
    lifeExp_max = max(lifeExp),
    lifeExp_mean = mean(lifeExp)
  )

```

---

##[dplyr tutorial0](https://anderfernandez.com/en/blog/dplyr-tutorial/)


---
## if_else command alongwith mutate
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(avgLifeExp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  mutate(over75 = if_else(avgLifeExp > 70, "Y", "N"))

```

---
## Total Population by Continets in 2007

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year==2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarize(tot_pop=sum(pop)) 

```

---
## Percentiles

In general it is assumed that higher the GDP , higher the lifeExp. To test this assumption, lets calculate percentiles of lifeExp. This will indicate how many countries have ranking lower than the current country.

```{r}
gapminder %>% select(country,year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(percentile = ntile(lifeExp, 100)) %>%
  arrange(desc(gdpPercap))
```

One can notice that all countries are well above 60th percentile on lifeExpectancy when arranged by GDP per capita.

Before you conclude, lets see the bottom side
---
So it makes sense that higher the GDP, higher the lifeExp. This is not formal testing but exploratory data makes lot of sense here.
```{r}
gapminder %>% select(country,year, lifeExp, gdpPercap) %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>%
  mutate(percentile = ntile(lifeExp, 100)) %>%
  arrange(gdpPercap)
```
---
# Advanced Analysis

Filtering data as done in introductory analysis seems quite difficult if you are not familiar with these simple things. But if you are working with dplyr for quite sometime, there is not anything very advanced or difficult.

For example, let's say you have to find out the top 10 countries in the 90th percentile regarding life expectancy in 2007. You can reuse some of the logic from the previous sections, but answering this question alone requires `multiple filtering` and `subsetting`:
  
  ```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(year==2007) %>% 
  mutate(percentile=ntile(lifeExp,100)) %>% 
  filter(percentile>90) %>% 
  arrange(desc(percentile)) %>% 
  top_n(10,wt=percentile) %>% 
  select(country,continent,lifeExp,gdpPercap)

```
---
  In case you are interested in bottom 10 (worst lifeExp countries from the bottom), use `top_n` with `-10`.

```{r}
gapminder %>% filter(year==2007) %>% 
  mutate(percentile=ntile(lifeExp,100)) %>% 
  filter(percentile<10) %>% 
  arrange(percentile) %>% 
  top_n(-10,wt=percentile) %>% 
  select(country,continent,lifeExp,gdpPercap)


```

  # Visualizing data to get data insight
  Visualizing data is one of the most important aspect of getting data insight and may provide a better data insight than a complicated model. Visualizing large data sets were not an easy task, so researchers relied on mathematical and core econometric/regression models. `ggplot2` which is a set of `tidyverse` package is probably one of the greatest tool for data visualization used in `R`. In the following sections we are going to visualize `gapminder` data.

Stat graphics is a mapping of variable to `aes`thetic attributes of `geom`etric objects.
---
  ## 3 Essential components of `ggplot2`
  
  -   data: dataset containing the variables of interest
-   geom: geometric object in question line, point, bars
-   aes:  aesthetic attributes of an object x/y position, colors, shape, size

---
  ## Scatter plot
  
  ```{r}

gapminder2007<-gapminder %>% filter(year==2007)
p1<-ggplot(data=gapminder2007,mapping = aes(x=gdpPercap,y=lifeExp,color=continent,size=pop))+geom_point()
p1+facet_wrap(~continent)
p1+  labs(x = "GDP Per Capita", y = "Life Expectancy in Years",
          title = "Economic Growth and Life Expectancy",
          subtitle = "Data points are country-years",
          caption = "Source: Gapminder.")

```

---
  ## Bubbleplot
  
  
  ```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# Show a bubbleplot

data <- gapminder %>% filter(year=="2007") %>% select(-year)

data %>%
  mutate(pop=pop/1000000) %>%
  arrange(desc(pop)) %>%
  mutate(country = factor(country, country)) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.7) +
  scale_size(range = c(1.4, 19), name="Population (M)") +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE, guide=FALSE) +
  theme_ipsum() +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
```

---
  If you just want to highlight the relationship between gbp per capita and life Expectancy you’ve probably done most of the work now. However, it is a good practice to highlight a few interesting dots in this chart to give more insight to the plot:
  
  
  
  ```{r echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
# Prepare data
tmp <- data %>%
  mutate(
    annotation = case_when(
      gdpPercap > 5000 & lifeExp < 60 ~ "yes",
      lifeExp < 30 ~ "yes",
      gdpPercap > 40000 ~ "yes"
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(pop=pop/1000000) %>%
  arrange(desc(pop)) %>%
  mutate(country = factor(country, country))

# Plot
ggplot( tmp, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, size = pop, color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.7) +
  scale_size(range = c(1.4, 19), name="Population (M)") +
  scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE) +
  theme_ipsum() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  geom_text_repel(data=tmp %>% filter(annotation=="yes"), aes(label=country), size=4 )
```
