## [@shabnam2016]Modeling CPI data

Pakistan CPI data consists of 486 items prices collected regularly every month

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(fpp3)
library(tidyverse)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
